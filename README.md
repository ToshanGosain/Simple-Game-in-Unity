# Simple-Game-in-Unity
The game that I have created was made in a game engine by the name of Unity. Unity is a game engine that is friendly to people who are new to programming. With Unity, there has been over hundreds of thousands games created, including popular games such as Superhot, Kerbal Space Program, Monument Valley 2, and much more.

Above is a layout of what Unity looks like, and it's content. With everything available to me, I was able to create a game in which you are a cube whose objective is to dodge obstacles. Once you reach a certain score you will progress to the next level. If you fail to dodge the obstacles, the level restarts along with your score. You can move horizontally and vertically. You also cannot fall off the stage. Essentially with this project, I was introduced to collision, forces, rigidbodies, and more.
